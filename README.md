Pit Texas Hold Em AIs against each other

Pull down the code.
You'll implement a Player. (Extend the abstract Player class).
You'll get an object of all of the information a player at the table would know,
        and you return the decision that you make (Fold, Check, Call, Raise).
        This loop happens over and over again until one of the players wins the game.
